Below is a list of workshops that have been submitted.

If you would like to run your own workshop, please submit [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iFy1pa7OQhltZuHkO3znH08HnYIxXtARj7c_TRWtU9g/viewform?usp=send_form).  Applications close on the 15th of June.

## Bi- and Pan-sexuality: Antagonism, Invisibility and Erasure

Bisexuality has been part of the LGBTIQA+ acronym for years, but is still viewed by many with suspicion. In this workshop we explore how bi/pan antagonism, invisibility and erasure manifest both within mainstream society and the LGBTIQA+ community, including how compulsory monogamy interacts with non-monosexuality. We will critically engage with the term 'bisexual' itself and why many people who experience fluid attraction or are attracted to more than one gender do not identify with the label and/or the LGBTIQA+ community. In light of this we will discuss the barriers to building community around non-monosexuality and brainstorm ways of improving the visibility and inclusion of non-monosexual people.

## Writing I: Re-imagining Gender Identities Through Creative Practice

In this 1.5 hour writing workshop participants will be introduced to ways of thinking gender through a short seminar and discussion, followed by a 45 minute guided writing session. Participants are not expected to share the work they produce, although there will be some opportunity for creators to discuss their writing towards the end of the workshop if they wish.  The workshop aims to encourage writing of all styles including but not limited to: fiction, creative nonfiction, blogging, poetry, song writing and performance writing. Creators of all levels and styles are welcome.  Please bring along a pen and some paper.

## The Story Is Out

Coming out stories workshop.

## Marxist Alternative to Privilege Theory

Marxism offers a relevant and potent critique of identity politics, privilege theory, intersectionality and queer theory.

## "Fuck Yeah Hot Lesbians": The Fetishization of Queer Women's Relationships

This is a space for conversation about the objectification and fetishization of relationships between queer women. We recognise that this objectification affects people of other genders who may experience oppression as women as well. In the workshop, we will be exploring fetishization as an aspect of homophobia and biphobia and will be discussing personal experiences as well as media representations.  (This workshop is autonomous (only open) to women and sex and gender diverse identifying people.)

## UNSW Buff Club

UNSW Buff Club is a body-positive workout group. The idea is recycled from Buff Clubs held in Melbourne and Newtown, which were created as safe spaces for those who feel uncomfortable in gyms, because of the machismo, gender stereotyping and body-shaming that can be present, or because they simply couldn't afford to go.   The group's focus is on physical strength and mental health, because exercise is a great tool for dealing with stress. We do not use body shaming tactics as so called motivation, and no-one is obligated to complete any exercises they feel unable to or do not want to. We begin each workout with a conversation about body-positivity or body image and discuss how we can create a positive space for exercising. The workout will run for 30 mins with three 6 min intervals followed by stretching. Please bring comfortable clothes, a bottle of water and a towel if necessary. 

## Postgrad Catchup

A space to meet other postgrads and discuss what you want for the postgrad queer world, including directing the Queer Officer of the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations.

## Mentors in Violence Prevention

Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) is an evidence-based program that is designed on best
practices developed over two decades of dealinglivering gender violence prevention and education
trainings with diverse and varying populations. The MVP model uses a bystander approach to
prevention and intervention that empowers leaders to thinking more critically and personally
about intimate partner and sexual violence.  This approach decreases defensiveness and
helplessness and enables participants to develop concrete options for intervention in the face
of harmful and abusive behaviour.

MVP Australia has developed curriculum for LGBTIQ communities to create an opportunity to
have a conversation about the ways intimate partner and sexual violence impact their lives and
the lives of those they care about.

## Poetry is Power: Queer Narratives as Means of Accessing Political Discourse

Too often marginalised identities (especially queer identities) are excluded from political discourse. In the last fifteen years, there has been a resurgence of poetry produced as a means of re-entering this discourse by such groups. In this seminar-style workshop, we will look at some methodologies that have been used to create power out of our words and bodies, and discuss other possible methods of creating queer political poetry. This workshop will incorporate traditionally published, slam, and online poetry.

## Communication for Change

This workshop aims to teach people about the different ways of changing people's opinions and behaviours.  There will be a focus on campaigns that students and student organisations can run to improve their university.

## Dysphoria and Medical Transition

Ever wondered what gender dysphoria is?  What the leading theories of the cause for gender dysphoria are?  Have you ever been curious about the various medications, therapies and surgeries that are available for transgender people to alleviate dysphoria?  Then this workshop is for you.

## Science of Sex, Sexuality and Safe Sex

This workshop will be about sex!  But it will also be about science (sorry).  We'll be discussing the science of sexuality and how to make sex as safe as possible.

## Ending Queer Youth Homelessness

Homelessness disproportionately affects queer youth in many ways, such as being forced out of home due to sexuality and/or gender and the lack of services safely accessible by queer youth.

This workshop will explore some of the factors behind queer youth homelessness and the ways in which queer collectives, student networks and community organisations can support homeless queer youth and end queer youth homelessness.

The workshop will conclude with an action plan for a national Ending Queer Youth Homelessness campaign to be run through the Australian Queer Student Network (AQSN) and relevant organisations, charities and queer collectives starting Semester 2, 2015. 

## Queer Student Networks

State and national queer student networks have the potential to pool (often leftover) resources of campus queer collectives, run state campaigns and support those run nationally, host great social and networking events and provide services for queer students in need.

From 2014, we have seen queer student networks begin to activate across the country, some with active budgets and large fundraising events that have sent delegates to QC and organised large queer student campaigns.

This workshop will explore the potential of queer student networks, methods to establish and generate support for these networks, what these networks should look like and how they should be run. It will draw on current and past successes and failures and draw up resources to support queer student networks forming and working effectively.

## Self-defence by a trans woman

Not autonomous, just be aware transphobic bullshit won't be tolerated. Leftists very welcome. I am a qualified instructor in Krav Maga. Attacks against trans women (particularly of colour) are brutal and so the defence will be brutal. I want to give everyone a technique to defend themselves from violence in the workshop and will endeavour to specifically address the needs of disabled people but this is not something I have been trained to do; I will try. If hearing a clinical description of violence and seeing it (and the defence against it) performed is something you are unable to deal with for whatever reason, I would advise not attending as it is unfortunately necessary given the context of the workshop. If you need to leave during the workshop that is perfectly okay and you may either leave on your own, a volunteer will take you where you need to go, or I will happily pause the class to make sure you get somewhere safe.

## An aro to the heart: Aceing relationships

This workshop will cover the basics of ace and aro relationship theory and how it can be applied to any relationship. 

## QUIDDITCH

Quidditch is a mixed gender sport, so, that's relevant to queer*, right? Right. I mean, mostly I just want to play quidditch, and so should you!

We'll quickly go over how to play at each session before getting into some casual games for the rest of the hour (each game being approximately 20 minutes). Yes, you will be required to run around with a broom between your legs.

If you wanted to have a super basic look at how to play, feel free to visit the [rulebook](http://www.iqaquidditch.org/rulebook.php).

## Queer Cyber Safety

Staying safe online is important for everyone, especially queer and gender diverse people.

We'll cover everything from staying safe while using dating apps, how to restrict what is shown on your Facebook profile, to general online tips and tricks that you mightn't have seen before with interactive group discussions and a Q&A session to finish!

## Achieving Gender Neutral Bathrooms

Swinburne University have secured gender neutral bathrooms and this workshop will share step by step how this was achieved and as a group we can share ideas of how you can achieve them at your university.

## Conference Floor and Motions 101

Coming to Queer Collaborations for a first time and keen for Conference Floor?
Been before but didn't really engage with Conference Floor?
Have a great idea for a motion but don't know how to put it to Conference Floor?
Come along to this workshop where we'll run through how Conference Floor works, how to write motions and generally attempt to demystify Conference Floor.

## Crochet 101

Learn some crochet from the very beginning. This is a hands-on workshop. Supplies (and therefore numbers) are limited.

## Crafternoon

Craftivism is about acknowledging the awesome power of feminised forms of art to unleash creativity, achieve political goals and bind communities together. Crafts have a long history in activism: coded patterns have been built into quilts and fabrics, knit ins have eroded the public/private binary and self-expression through art can give voice to the marginalised. Craftivism can be powerful too -- activists dancing in giant tampon suits in front of Parliament House made the national news.

This community workshop will play around with the theme "Queer at Heart" and will ask participants to decorate squares of fabric using fabric paints, needles, thread, yarn and fabric. These squares will be sewn together to create a quilt-like banner or wall hanging. This banner could feature in the end of week action or beautify a queer space.

Because crafting materials cost money, participants are invited to make an optional donation to cover the cost. Crafting supplies will also be greatly appreciated.

We will also need a supply of scrap paper to keep surfaces clean, and are hoping that Canberra residents can stockpile some.

## How to run QC

Do you want to run a Queer Collaborations? In this workshop members from QCOC 2015 will describe how they organised the conference, the things that were easy, the challenges, and what you should keep in mind when running your QC.

## Queer and Kinky

Queer & Kinky will discuss various forms of kink within the queer community. There are many types of non-vanilla sexual interests enjoyed by some queers & non-queers with some of the more common ones including (but certainly not limited to): BDSM, Role-Play, Leather, Sock/Foot fetishes etc.

This workshop will be divided into two sections with the first part providing a more general exploration of kink & issues faced by kinky queers. In the second part we will then discuss ideas for how collectives could potentially support and establish safer spaces for kinky queer uni students to connect with each other and access important resources.

#### Part 1

- Diversity of kinks & fetishes
- Mainstream misperceptions & stereotypes
- Connecting with other kinksters (including through existing groups & online)
- How to develop a healthy self-acceptance & self-esteem about having kinky interests

#### Part 2

- A look at some of the established student kink societies which exist at different universities around the world including groups at UK and US unis. These groups act as social, support & discussion groups and provide a safer, non-judgemental environment for like-minded people to hang out.

- Discussion about whether similar clubs could be implemented at Australian unis including the benefits & challenges of doing this.

- Discussion of other ways collectives have approached kink & related topics through workshops etc. or ideas for how they can do this in the future.

_Anyone is welcome to attend whether you're kinky, curious or just interested in learning more. However, please keep in mind that many people attending may not be fully open about their interests in kink. Also, the discussion of any kinks & fetishes in this workshop will follow the principles of Safe, Sane & Consensual and anyone who does not respect this will be asked to leave._

## 'I want to [verb] your [noun]' - Negotiating Enthusiastic Consent

Negotiating enthusiastic consent in the bedroom (or the dungeon) doesn't have to be hard and it definitely doesn't have to be awkward. By first looking at the ways in which an enthusiastic consent framework is used in kink contexts, we can extrapolate this to see how enthusiastic consent negotiations everywhere can be fun and downright sexy!

## Play Piercing 101

Needles don't always have to be a bad thing!
Play piercing involves the use of sterile hypodermic needles inserted through the skin. Depending on the types of needles used and the location of the piercing, it can be a form of art, a sadomasochistic pursuit that leaves everyone floating, or a form of BDSM play that really gets under your skin.
This session will include a discussion about the materials you will need, where to find them, the proper way to use/dispose of them, safety considerations, as well as a demonstration of (some of) the techniques you can use to explore this type of SM play.

## Fighting and winning marriage equality

The fight for marriage equality kicked off in 2004, when the Liberal party under PM John Howard and ALP voted to ban same-sex marriage. After a fierce grass roots struggle lasting eleven years, we are on the cusp of a great victory. But we are not there yet. We call on the ALP and the Coalition to stop playing with our lives. They are point scoring with our rights, our relationships. We want full equality, and we want it now. The campaign is demanding the all parties put a bill, and pass a bill. When we win marriage equality, the fight for trans and intersex rights, the fight to remove the right for churches to sack LGBTIQ people from their jobs, and their schools, and the fight to free queer refugees, among many battles, still remain. Come and hear about the history of this campaign, how we can win it, and the fight for full rainbow liberation.

Presenter: Rachel Evans has been an active campaigner for marriage equality since 2004 in Sydney's Community Action Against Homophobia ,NUS Queer office in 2007, and is the acting SUPRA Queer officer for 2015/2016

## The origins of queer and women's oppression - a material analysis of oppression

Have lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender and intersex, queer, asexual (LGBTIQA) people been oppressed? Have women always been second class citizens? No! This workshop will explain how sexism, homophobia and racism developed. Oppression has a material basis. With class society came the oppression of women and establishment of rigid gender binaries that oppress LGBTIQA people. Women and LGBTIQ oppression is systematic - built into the economic, political and cultural structure that make up our society. Many of us at Queer Collaborations will be dedicated to the fight against oppression in all its forms. To make the most of our efforts in this fight we need to understand where our oppression originates from, so we can get to the heart of who our enemies are, who to target, and how we can win our liberation.

## Rainbow Revolutions, Cuba and Venezuela, Latin America

The Latin American anti-capitalist revolutions - led by Cuba in 1959, and followed today by Venezeuala, Ecuador, Bolivia and others, have advanced rights for the poor, and the rainbow community.
In Australia homeless queers go hungry on the street - in Cuba no one is homeless. In Australia we have rising rates of HIV. In Cuba AIDS drugs are given away for free - all health care is free. 
In Australia transgender operations can be up to $20,000. 
In Cuba they have made a special effort to educate surgeons to carry out transgender operations with Mariela Castro leading a sexual rights revolution. 
Trans operations are free. Education is free. The revolution provides for all basic needs. Has the anti-capitalist Cuban revolution, that took place in 1959, been a haven for queers? Pride parades are growing exponentially. All of this is great news for queers. Perhaps the best news we've heard in years. How does all of this sound to you? Perhaps it sounds too good to be true? Venezuela, and their unfolding revolution, after 1999, is a beacon for the poor and marginalised. How has it treated queers? A good deal, or a bit raw? Come to this forum and find out more. The Latin American revolutions are just too exciting to ignore.

## Knit and Knatter

Come and relax of the stress of QC with some knitting and crochetting!

Bring you knitting needles, crochet needles, sewing, wool or anything really!!
There will be someone there to help if you want to come and learn how to knit or crochet and free wool and needles for those who have forgotten to bring theirs!

## Queer and Tea

Brewing tea is an artform, it's history extends beyond the simply placing a tea bag in the cup.  

This workshop will take form in an environment which is both safe and inclusive of all queer identifying people. It aims to provide participants with a lesson in how to brew tea; (offering attendees to taste samples) and what benefits differing teas may bring. 

A discussion will take place, in which all participants will feel free to engage in topics they feel are most relevant to our struggles as a queer students. In hopes this will form life-long bonds and connections. 

## Mental Health and the Queer Community

A look into how mental health and queer issues interact, possible influences and causes of mental illnesses in the queer population, and potential solutions to the problem. 

## Polyamory 101 and Poly Panel

A brief introduction to polyamory and other forms of non-monogamy including open relationships, hierarchical relationships and relationship anarchy.

This will be followed by a panel discussion where the audience can ask questions about non-monogamy to a variety of people within the poly community.

## SHFPACT Safer Sex

Nothing’s sexier than staying safe during sex. Erin Smith from Sexual Health and Family Planning ACT will be sharing with participants the ‘ins and outs’ of safer sexual practices for same sex attracted, intersex and gender diverse peeps. Erin will take a holistic approach to staying safe by discussing consent, sexy decision making skills, preventing STIs, toys, kink,  BDSM and celebrating healthy diversity. So school sex education left you feeling high and dry, this won’t!

## Queerying the Law

Knowledge is power.

And so this workshop will seek to empower Queer students to understand the legal system, and their rights under it.

Issues of interest generally are:

- Domestic Violence
- Police Powers
- Relationships and Separation

But to best run this, we need to know your chief concerns and areas you'd like clarified, so people are able to email us at queeryinglaw@gmail.com to help guide the workshop.

This workshop will be run by Queensland Law students. 
Thomas Parer is a fifth year Law/Arts student, with experience in working in a family and criminal firm, and has worked in the LGBTI Legal Service.

Annie Danks is a final year Arts/Law student and the UQU Queer Officer.   She's been involved in campaigning for law reform and has spoken to way too many politicians for her taste.

## Introduction to Bondage

Bondage is a sensual way for people to connect and exchange power.  Through bondage it is possible to surrender control to another person and with trust and safety let go. For the person doing the bondage, the sense of power afforded you when you control another person is an immense and humbling experience.

This workshop will discuss the basics of bondage including an introduction to consent and safety including pre-play discussion and negotiation, safe words, safety equipments and practices and what to do if things go wrong.

Next we will discuss the reasons people tie up or restrain each other.  This is the most important part of the workshop.  Why you tie or restrain someone is more important than how you restrain them and we'll talk about how to put your intent at the forefront of play.

We will then discuss the various forms of bondage including rope, cuffs, chains, cages, household items and even talk about how to do bondage with just your mind!

Finally we will get into trying a few simple techniques for bondage using rope.  There will be a chance for people to learn and try some really basic rope techniques and to practice on themselves or with a friend.  You will learn 2-3 different ways to tie someone up in several different scenarios.

I will provide samples of a several different types of rope for people to try out and practice with and some safety equipment on the day. I also sell EMT shear (safety scissors) if people want some on the day.

A handout will be provided with information on resources for bondage including details on books and websites I recommend and place to buy equipment and safety gear.

## Is the queer community really inclusive of all queer people?

Is the queer community really inclusive of all queer people? This is a workshop where we take the time to focus on dissecting the varying complex facets of queer activism, questioning whether the rich diversity of the queer community is truly well-represented within itself.

From whitewashing to pinkwashing, sexism to erasure, racism to biphobia and transphobia being perpetuated within the queer community, we would like to make sure that issues are discussed and listened to in a healthy manner so that we can tackle them, in order to better address the implications of failing to tackle them properly. Who knows, one day we may even be able to bake a cake full of rainbows and smiles, and everyone would eat and be happy...

## Jewellery Making 101

This is a hands-on workshop where you can learn about making your own jewellery from the very beginning! You will even be able to make your own necklace, bracelet, or earrings out of beads, wire, clasps, and tigertail. Supplies (and numbers) are limited.

## HIV Risk and Prevention

What do you need to know about HIV?  Living with HIV, prevention, transmission, safer sex and PEP with plenty of time for questions in a non-judgemental environment.

## Workshop on running women's workshops

Stepping Out: Discuss ideas about how to run a fun interactive coming out workshop for queer, lesbian, bisexual, asexual women, who are interested in same sex relationships with other women. Stepping Out workshops can be fun to attend but cover  important topics such as internalised and externalised homophobia, meeting women, speed networking, finding friends, lovers and a community, Promoting healthy relationships in the LGBTIQ community and preventing Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.

## Safer Injection

We can answer any questions in a non-judgemental environment.  Run by the Aids Action Council.

## Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me: Sensation Play Skills for Beginners 

By far the most poorly defined discipline in the kink world, Sensation Play involves utilising the interplay between pleasure and pain, and stimulation and deprivation to create intense and intimate experiences. Siren Vandoll has spent more than four years tirelessly developing and perfecting her sensation play repertoire and knowledge through personal research, mentorship from some of Australia’s most prominent players and a lot of trial-and-error. In this skill-based workshop Siren will teach you the basics you need to begin your sensation play journey; including tactile implements like feathers, talons and pinwheels, entry-level temperature play, some useful anatomy, as well as scene structure and safety, negotiation and hygiene. She will also discuss ways to integrate sensation elements into your regular scenes, and demonstrate some more advanced techniques such as electro, knife and fire play. This workshop works best with a (non-sexual) contact-friendly buddy to practice on, but is still valuable for those more comfortable watching. 

## Sexy, Kinky and Absolutely Terrified: A Primer for Fledgling Kinksters 

So, You know you’re kinky… but now what? In this session, Siren will cover everything you need to know about exploring your sexuality in safe but exciting ways. This workshop will help you learn about and find your place in the BDSM world, develop your identity and better understand your kinks, needs and fetishes. Siren will discuss the most popular kinds of play and cover the basic skills involved. The class will cover ways to stay physically, emotionally and psychologically safe on your journey and how to get the most out of your experiences. While aimed at beginners in the public scene, the seminar will also assist those hoping to explore in private and help more experienced kinksters guide and mentor newbies in their own communities.
