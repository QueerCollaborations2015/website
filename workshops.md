## Sex Industry 101

Teaching how to make spaces inclusive and supportive of sex workers, dispelling myths about the sex industry from an intersectional perspective. 

## Bi- and pan-sexuality: Antagonism, invisibility and erasure

Bisexuality has been part of the LGBTIQA+ acronym for years, but is still viewed by many with suspicion. In this workshop we explore how bi/pan antagonism, invisibility and erasure manifest both within mainstream society and the LGBTIQA+ community, including how compulsory monogamy interacts with non-monosexuality. We will critically engage with the term 'bisexual' itself and why many people who experience fluid attraction or are attracted to more than one gender do not identify with the label and/or the LGBTIQA+ community. In light of this we will discuss the barriers to building community around non-monosexuality and brainstorm ways of improving the visibility and inclusion of non-monosexual people.

## Writing I: Re-imagining Gender Identities Through Creative Practice

In this 1.5 hour writing workshop participants will be introduced to ways of thinking gender through a short seminar and discussion, followed by a 45 minute guided writing session. Participants are not expected to share the work they produce, although there will be some opportunity for creators to discuss their writing towards the end of the workshop if they wish.  The workshop aims to encourage writing of all styles including but not limited to: fiction, creative nonfiction, blogging, poetry, song writing and performance writing. Creators of all levels and styles are welcome.  Please bring along a pen and some paper.

## The Story Is Out

Coming out stories workshop.

## Marxist Alternative to Privilege Theory

Marxism offers a relevant and potent critique of identity politics, privilege theory, intersectionality and queer theory.

## "Fuck Yeah Hot Lesbians": The fetishization of queer women's relationships

This is a space for conversation about the objectification and fetishization of relationships between queer women. We recognise that this objectification affects people of other genders who may experience oppression as women as well. In the workshop, we will be exploring fetishization as an aspect of homophobia and biphobia and will be discussing personal experiences as well as media representations.  (This workshop is autonomous (only open) to women and sex and gender diverse identifying people.)

## UNSW Buff Club

UNSW Buff Club is a body-positive workout group. The idea is recycled from Buff Clubs held in Melbourne and Newtown, which were created as safe spaces for those who feel uncomfortable in gyms, because of the machismo, gender stereotyping and body-shaming that can be present, or because they simply couldn't afford to go.   The group's focus is on physical strength and mental health, because exercise is a great tool for dealing with stress. We do not use body shaming tactics as so called motivation, and no-one is obligated to complete any exercises they feel unable to or do not want to. We begin each workout with a conversation about body-positivity or body image and discuss how we can create a positive space for exercising. The workout will run for 30 mins with three 6 min intervals followed by stretching. Please bring comfortable clothes, a bottle of water and a towel if necessary. 

## Postgrad Catchup

A space to meet other postgrads and discuss what you want for the postgrad queer world, including directing the Queer Officer of the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations.
