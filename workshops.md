## Sex Industry 101

Teaching how to make spaces inclusive and supportive of sex workers, dispelling myths about the sex industry from an intersectional perspective. 

## Bi- and Pan-sexuality: Antagonism, Invisibility and Erasure

Bisexuality has been part of the LGBTIQA+ acronym for years, but is still viewed by many with suspicion. In this workshop we explore how bi/pan antagonism, invisibility and erasure manifest both within mainstream society and the LGBTIQA+ community, including how compulsory monogamy interacts with non-monosexuality. We will critically engage with the term 'bisexual' itself and why many people who experience fluid attraction or are attracted to more than one gender do not identify with the label and/or the LGBTIQA+ community. In light of this we will discuss the barriers to building community around non-monosexuality and brainstorm ways of improving the visibility and inclusion of non-monosexual people.

## Writing I: Re-imagining Gender Identities Through Creative Practice

In this 1.5 hour writing workshop participants will be introduced to ways of thinking gender through a short seminar and discussion, followed by a 45 minute guided writing session. Participants are not expected to share the work they produce, although there will be some opportunity for creators to discuss their writing towards the end of the workshop if they wish.  The workshop aims to encourage writing of all styles including but not limited to: fiction, creative nonfiction, blogging, poetry, song writing and performance writing. Creators of all levels and styles are welcome.  Please bring along a pen and some paper.

## The Story Is Out

Coming out stories workshop.

## Marxist Alternative to Privilege Theory

Marxism offers a relevant and potent critique of identity politics, privilege theory, intersectionality and queer theory.

## "Fuck Yeah Hot Lesbians": The Fetishization of Queer Women's Relationships

This is a space for conversation about the objectification and fetishization of relationships between queer women. We recognise that this objectification affects people of other genders who may experience oppression as women as well. In the workshop, we will be exploring fetishization as an aspect of homophobia and biphobia and will be discussing personal experiences as well as media representations.  (This workshop is autonomous (only open) to women and sex and gender diverse identifying people.)

## UNSW Buff Club

UNSW Buff Club is a body-positive workout group. The idea is recycled from Buff Clubs held in Melbourne and Newtown, which were created as safe spaces for those who feel uncomfortable in gyms, because of the machismo, gender stereotyping and body-shaming that can be present, or because they simply couldn't afford to go.   The group's focus is on physical strength and mental health, because exercise is a great tool for dealing with stress. We do not use body shaming tactics as so called motivation, and no-one is obligated to complete any exercises they feel unable to or do not want to. We begin each workout with a conversation about body-positivity or body image and discuss how we can create a positive space for exercising. The workout will run for 30 mins with three 6 min intervals followed by stretching. Please bring comfortable clothes, a bottle of water and a towel if necessary. 

## Postgrad Catchup

A space to meet other postgrads and discuss what you want for the postgrad queer world, including directing the Queer Officer of the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations.

## Mentors in Violence Prevention

Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) is an evidence-based program that is designed on best
practices developed over two decades of dealinglivering gender violence prevention and education
trainings with diverse and varying populations. The MVP model uses a bystander approach to
prevention and intervention that empowers leaders to thinking more critically and personally
about intimate partner and sexual violence.  This approach decreases defensiveness and
helplessness and enables participants to develop concrete options for intervention in the face
of harmful and abusive behaviour.

MVP Australia has developed curriculum for LGBTIQ communities to create an opportunity to
have a conversation about the ways intimate partner and sexual violence impact their lives and
the lives of those they care about.

## Poetry is Power: Queer Narratives as Means of Accessing Political Discourse

Too often marginalised identities (especially queer identities) are excluded from political discourse. In the last fifteen years, there has been a resurgence of poetry produced as a means of re-entering this discourse by such groups. In this seminar-style workshop, we will look at some methodologies that have been used to create power out of our words and bodies, and discuss other possible methods of creating queer political poetry. This workshop will incorporate traditionally published, slam, and online poetry.

## Communication for Change

This workshop aims to teach people about the different ways of changing people's opinions and behaviours.  There will be a focus on campaigns that students and student organisations can run to improve their university.

## Dysphoria and Medical Transition

Ever wondered what gender dysphoria is?  What the leading theories of the cause for gender dysphoria are?  Have you ever been curious about the various medications, therapies and surgeries that are available for transgender people to alleviate dysphoria?  Then this workshop is for you.

## Science of Sex, Sexuality and Safe Sex

This workshop will be about sex!  But it will also be about science (sorry).  We'll be discussing the science of sexuality and how to make sex as safe as possible.

## Ending Queer Youth Homelessness

Homelessness disproportionately affects queer youth in many ways, such as being forced out of home due to sexuality and/or gender and the lack of services safely accessible by queer youth.

This workshop will explore some of the factors behind queer youth homelessness and the ways in which queer collectives, student networks and community organisations can support homeless queer youth and end queer youth homelessness.

The workshop will conclude with an action plan for a national Ending Queer Youth Homelessness campaign to be run through the Australian Queer Student Network (AQSN) and relevant organisations, charities and queer collectives starting Semester 2, 2015. 

## Queer Student Networks

State and national queer student networks have the potential to pool (often leftover) resources of campus queer collectives, run state campaigns and support those run nationally, host great social and networking events and provide services for queer students in need.

From 2014, we have seen queer student networks begin to activate across the country, some with active budgets and large fundraising events that have sent delegates to QC and organised large queer student campaigns.

This workshop will explore the potential of queer student networks, methods to establish and generate support for these networks, what these networks should look like and how they should be run. It will draw on current and past successes and failures and draw up resources to support queer student networks forming and working effectively.

## Self-defence by a trans woman

Not autonomous, just be aware transphobic bullshit won't be tolerated. Leftists very welcome. I am a qualified instructor in Krav Maga. Attacks against trans women (particularly of colour) are brutal and so the defence will be brutal. I want to give everyone a technique to defend themselves from violence in the workshop and will endeavour to specifically address the needs of disabled people but this is not something I have been trained to do; I will try. If hearing a clinical description of violence and seeing it (and the defence against it) performed is something you are unable to deal with for whatever reason, I would advise not attending as it is unfortunately necessary given the context of the workshop. If you need to leave during the workshop that is perfectly okay and you may either leave on your own, a volunteer will take you where you need to go, or I will happily pause the class to make sure you get somewhere safe.

## An aro to the heart: Aceing relationships

This workshop will cover the basics of ace and aro relationship theory and how it can be applied to any relationship. 

## QUIDDITCH

Quidditch is a mixed gender sport, so, that's relevant to queer*, right? Right. I mean, mostly I just want to play quidditch, and so should you!

We'll quickly go over how to play at each session before getting into some casual games for the rest of the hour (each game being approximately 20 minutes). Yes, you will be required to run around with a broom between your legs.

If you wanted to have a super basic look at how to play, feel free to visit the [rulebook](http://www.iqaquidditch.org/rulebook.php).

## Queer Cyber Safety

Staying safe online is important for everyone, especially queer and gender diverse people.

We'll cover everything from staying safe while using dating apps, how to restrict what is shown on your Facebook profile, to general online tips and tricks that you mightn't have seen before with interactive group discussions and a Q&A session to finish!

## Achieving Gender Neutral Bathrooms

Swinburne University have secured gender neutral bathrooms and this workshop will share step by step how this was achieved and as a group we can share ideas of how you can achieve them at your university.

## Conference Floor and Motions 101

Coming to Queer Collaborations for a first time and keen for Conference Floor?
Been before but didn't really engage with Conference Floor?
Have a great idea for a motion but don't know how to put it to Conference Floor?
Come along to this workshop where we'll run through how Conference Floor works, how to write motions and generally attempt to demystify Conference Floor.

## Crochet 101

Learn some crochet from the very beginning. This is a hands-on workshop. Supplies (and therefore numbers) are limited.

## Crafternoon

Craftivism is about acknowledging the awesome power of feminised forms of art to unleash creativity, achieve political goals and bind communities together. Crafts have a long history in activism: coded patterns have been built into quilts and fabrics, knit ins have eroded the public/private binary and self-expression through art can give voice to the marginalised. Craftivism can be powerful too -- activists dancing in giant tampon suits in front of Parliament House made the national news.

This community workshop will play around with the theme "Queer at Heart" and will ask participants to decorate squares of fabric using fabric paints, needles, thread, yarn and fabric. These squares will be sewn together to create a quilt-like banner or wall hanging. This banner could feature in the end of week action or beautify a queer space.

Because crafting materials cost money, participants are invited to make an optional donation to cover the cost. Crafting supplies will also be greatly appreciated.

We will also need a supply of scrap paper to keep surfaces clean, and are hoping that Canberra residents can stockpile some.
