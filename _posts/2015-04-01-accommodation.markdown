Queer Collaborations 2015 will not be providing delegates with accommodation.  This is because there isn’t a venue that can accommodate for the quantity of delegates that we are expecting and there is not a second comparable accommodation provider for large groups within a reasonable distance and price range. Please note that NOWSA in 2012 did not organise accommodation and SOS in 2014 facilitating camping rather than hostel-style accommodation.

We recommend staying with the Canberra YHA, as they are close to the conference and the city, and have the cheapest rates.  They have kindly provided delegates with a 10% discount as below:

4 Share dorm - $36 per person per night
8 Share dorm - $33 per person per night
Twin/Double room - $103 per room per night
Twin/Double en-suite room - $148 per room per night
5 Beds en-suite room - $180 per room per night

All bookings for the YHA need to be placed via calling (02) 6248 9155 or e-mail canberracity@yha.com.au, quote “QC15” or Queer Collaborations for the discounted rate. The discounted rates are not bookable via any other booking channels.  If anything happens to you while staying at the YHA the hostel reserves the right to move people to other rooms or to remove people from the premises and cancel their stay.

Another option is University House, which has rooms with four beds for $150/night, which is an affordable alternative to the YHA, however there are a limited number of rooms.  Please see their website for more information: [http://unihouse.anu.edu.au/hotel-accommodation/rooms-rates/](http://unihouse.anu.edu.au/hotel-accommodation/rooms-rates/).

Other places that you can stay include Capital Executive Apartment Hotel, James Court Hotel, Novotel and Dickson Backpackers (strongly not recommended, use as absolute last resort).

We recommend you book from the 6th or 7th of July until the 13th.  Registration is happening on the morning of Tuesday the 7th, and the final party is on the night of Sunday the 12th.

If you do not have a group to book accommodation with, we have created a Facebook group that you can join to find people: [link](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1376018026057539/).  This group is moderated by the organising committee.  If for any reason you have issues with the Facebook group, please email us at [qcanu2015@gmail.com](mailto:qcanu2015@gmail.com)
